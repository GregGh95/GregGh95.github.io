This study examines how monetary policy impacts the conditional variation of the equity risk premia  through firm entry and exit dynamics. A model incorporating variety growth fluctuations assesses asset pricing dynamics after a monetary policy shock. The framework features an endogenous mechanism for firm entry and exit, along with nominal rigidities in prices and wages. Empirical evidence from a Bayesian VAR (BVAR) analysis is presented to validate the equity premiumâ€™s response to conventional expansionary monetary policy shocks. The monetary policy shock is identified through a procedure that combines sign restrictions with high-frequency instruments. The findings suggest that wage rigidity and firm dynamics are critical mechanisms through which monetary policy affects asset prices. While price rigidities alone have a limited impact, wage rigidities, whether isolated or combined with price rigidities, lead to substantial changes in the equity premium.
