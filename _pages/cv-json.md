* **Determinants of house prices in the Euro Area with**, with [Giorgia De Nora](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/authors/profiles/giorgia-de-nora.en.html) 

* **Endogenous firm exit and the Equity Premium** <br>
This paper explores the impact of endogenous firm exit on the equity premium. Building on endogenous product creation under a monopolistic competition framework with heterogeneous firms, we posit that each firm is endowed with a specific productivity level drawn from a Pareto distribution. Firms with a productivity below a certain threshold exit the market. Positive aggregate productivity shocks lower this threshold, leading to increased firm entry and reduced exit rates. This, in turn, reduces the equity premium by lowering the risk compensation required for equity. To validate our theoretical framework, we employ a Bayesian VAR analysis as an empirical counterpart. By integrating these elements, we provide a comprehensive understanding of how endogenous firm dynamics and market structure contribute to the variability of the equity premium, presenting new insights into the relationship between market conditions and equity returns.

* **Monetary policy implications for asset pricing of the extensive margin channel** <br>
This study examines how monetary policy impacts the conditional variation of the equity risk premia through firm entry and exit dynamics. A model incorporating variety growth fluctuations assesses asset pricing dynamics after a monetary policy shock. The framework features an endogenous mechanism for firm entry and exit, along with nominal rigidities in prices and wages. Empirical evidence from a Bayesian VAR (BVAR) analysis is presented to validate the equity premiumâ€™s response to conventional expansionary monetary policy shocks. The monetary policy shock is identified through a procedure that combines sign restrictions with high-frequency instruments. The findings suggest that wage rigidity and firm dynamics are critical mechanisms through which monetary policy affects asset prices. While price rigidities alone have a limited impact, wage rigidities, whether isolated or combined with price rigidities, lead to substantial changes in the equity premium.
